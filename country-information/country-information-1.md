# FAQ

## How do country information help risk prevention?

Country information provide a first overview about the risk profile of a country. Reading the information will give you a first indication if travelling to the place is dangerous for your travelers or not. It also recommends the implementation of specific risk mitigation measures to reduce the risks for your travellers and fulfil your duty of care.

## Where do the data come from?

Country and city risk layers as well as incidents are the outcome of the AXA team’s work. All the information is peer-reviewed by analysts. Business and corruption layers are derived from publicly available sources \(e.g. World Bank etc.\). The foreign ministry digest is calculated by an average of the respective country risk ratings by key foreign ministries incl. Canada, US, Germany, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand etc.

## Is the country information up to date?

Our aim is to provide updates in real time. All content is updated automatically and in all languages as soon as key information e.g. security risk levels have been verified and changed by risk analysts. There are have no editors writing all these texts.

## Can I control what content my travellers can see?

Users with administrator permissions can define the content each user group \(traveller, manager, admin\) has access to, in the admin panel. Usually, travellers have no access to duty of care recommendations, business risks and liability recommendations.

## How can I change the language?

The platform’s content including all communication \(email and phone calls\) is available in several languages, among them French, German, English, Spanish, Italian, Japanese and many more depending on your company set up. Users can select their own language: They just need to go to their user profile and select the language they prefer.

## What is the difference between security information and the alerting in the travel monitor settings?

You can find the term “alert” for different kinds of information in the platform:

* Security information alerts report events in the country regardless of your location or your company set up. Security information alerts do not trigger any emergency procedures or calls.
* Security information alerts serve as a source of information about current developments in the specific country.
