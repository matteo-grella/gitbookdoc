# Travel Data Integration

### CHECK IN BUTTON IN THE NAVIGATION BAR 

The check in feature in the navigation bar serves as the shortest and most accurate way to submit a traveller’s position to the platform and integrate the person, based on the phone number and email address of his user profile, into the platform monitoring and alerting. The user will be monitored at exactly the geo-coordinates sent by the last check in. Managers can see the traveller and his position in the travel monitor. After seven days with no updated position, the monitoring will be terminated. This function is a huge advantage in cases where position data are rather inaccurate, e.g. if PNR travel data only provide the location of the arrival airport. Also, if there has been no time for another travel registration \(calendar or PNR registration\) at all, with the push of a button, the traveller is being taken care of by the platform’s monitoring and alerting after a few moments.

### CALENDAR TRIP REGISTRATION

Many times, your travellers cannot be monitored properly because you don’t know where they are? Why not? Incomplete booking data, spelling mistakes in names, missing or wrong phone numbers and email addresses make tracking and contacting your travellers difficult. So how can we solve this problem? We provide an efficient option to solve this problem – via trip registration through your personal calendar. 

The calendar registration allows your travellers to invite the platform to any of their appointments and trips worldwide. Travellers can invite the platform to their 3-day city trip with business meetings as well as to their visit to a project site located in a rural high-risk area and even to short stops along the road. The platform will be your travellers’ companion that informs them proactively if a security incident occurs and initiates emergency procedures, if it finds them in danger
