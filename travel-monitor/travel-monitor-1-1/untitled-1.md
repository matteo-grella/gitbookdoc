# Assistance

## Can my travellers call the 24/7 emergency number without receiving a special alert?

Yes, AXA Operation Centre will be there for you and your travellers 24/7.

## Can I write an email directly to my travellers out of the travel monitor or make a direct call?

Yes, select the traveller you want to contact using the filter. Click/touch on the phone or email icon in the traveller contact details, starting your phone or email client. This way, you can call or write an email instantly.

## How can I see my travellers and sites in the travel monitor?

Click/touch the icon for travellers and the traveller list will be displayed. Click/touch the icon for site and you will have your sites listed.

## Can I see details of a trip?

Yes, if you select a traveller from the list or in the map, the following trip details will be displayed, ordered by stops of the trip: the registered traveller location \(e.g. hotel\), the country, the coordinates and the duration of the respective stop. Please note that travel data from different sources \(PNR interface or calendar registration\) cannot be merged yet. That is a feature to come soon.

## What happens if the assistance provider calls the companyâ€™s internal emergency contacts and no one picks up the phone?

The AXA Operation Centre will continue to try to contact the internal emergency contacts. In any case, if there is an immediate threat to the life of travellers, and no internal contact can be reached, AXA will nevertheless support in order to save lives.

## In which time zone is the contact time \(call to travellers\) displayed?

Each user selects the time zone himself in the user profile. That is the time zone displayed in your account.
