# Operating the Travel Monitor

## What do I see and how do I operate it?

* Your company’s valuables – **travellers** and **sites** as well as **alerts** and all the relevant information details on them can be overviewed in the travel monitor. 
* The default view for desktop use is the 1:1 view, sharing the screen between **the navigation panel on the left and the map on the right**. All navigation including list selection will be mirrored in the map and vice-versa. If you select an item in the list, you will not only see the object details in the panel but also the object’s location on the map. 
* You can also navigate through the map, zoom in for a more detailed map view and choose between multiple risk and **information layers** using the layer navigation in the upper-right corner of the map. If you find the map too crowded, you can de-select, for example, sites and alerts to reduce the information and number of icons on the map.
