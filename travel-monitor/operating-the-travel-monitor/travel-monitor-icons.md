# Status and Icons

On the travel monitor map we use the following icons.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/travelmonitoricons.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Several travellers, sites and alerts in the same location \(depending on the zoom level\) are grouped in one icon. Click on the group icon to separate the information on each grouped object.
{% endhint %}

The traveller icons have different colours, depending on their **status within the past 72 hours**:

| Colour | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

### **How does the platform work and how can I see if travellers are affected by an incident?**

The platform automatically detects and communicates the status of registered travellers. It works as follows:

1. The platform finds a critical security incident, most likely posing a threat to your travellers in the vicinity..
2. The critical incident triggers a series of automated status calls and a special alert email, according to your individual settings in the travel monitor.
3. There are three possible status call feedbacks the platform can detect: **OK**, **HELP** or **NO RESPONSE**. The current status of the travellers is continuously updated in the travel monitor \(green **OK**, yellow in **PROCESS**, orange **UNKNOWN**, red **HELP**\). The statuses are also continuously communicated to the report recipients by email. If there is a need for action \(status Unknown or Help\), report recipients are in addition, explicitly informed by email.

### Can I check the status of a specific group of travellers?

You can also trigger the automated status detection manually, with no connection to a special alert incident. In this case, you select those travellers you need an updated status from in the traveller list and click the button „request status“. The platform will call the selected travellers and determine their status. You can follow the continuously updated statuses in the travel monitor \(green Ok, yellow in Process, orange Unknown, red Help\). If there is a need for action \(status Unknown or Help\), report recipients are also explicitly informed by email.
