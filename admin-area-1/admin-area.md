description: ADMINISTRATION OF USERS AND GROUPS

# Admin Area

If you are an administrator of the platform you have additional rights. You can **view**, **edit**, **delete**, **add** and **invite** users to the platform. 

### USERS

It is easy to add or invite users. To add a user just click “_Add User_” and type in all the details. With this option you will need to communicate username and password to the user by yourself. If you click “_Invite Users_” the platform will send out an email to all given recipients with an invite to register themselves. This option enables you to add multiple users at once.

### **GROUPS**

In this section you can view the available groups. Newly registered users are automatically added to the default group \(usually the Traveler group\). Only one group can be the default group in each organization.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note:** You are not allowed to delete the default group. Also, you cannot delete a group with existing users linked to this group.
{% endhint %}
